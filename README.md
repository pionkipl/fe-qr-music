# QR music (Frontend)

Some time ago I wanted a small app to store favourite music which I or my family
can play. Generated QR code can be printed and sticked to the wall. Once you scan the code
it brings you to my site where you can listen only one song that is loaded from backend.
The posibility to add music for others will be disabled, and now is enabled to check the app.
